# C Programming for Reverse Engineering & Systems Programming

> **Welcome to the C Systems & Reverse Engineering Course!**
> 
> Inspired by [Low Level Academy](https://lowlevel.academy/) and professional vulnerability research practices, this course teaches you the C programming language from the ground up—not just as high-level syntax, but as the direct abstraction over machine hardware, memory, and CPU execution.

## Why Learn C for Reverse Engineering?

Every reverse engineer, security researcher, and low-level developer eventually confronts an unavoidable reality:
* **Operating Systems are written in C:** The Linux kernel, macOS XNU, Windows NT, and embedded firmware are all authored in C.
* **Compilers target C semantics:** When IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Binary Ninja decompile stripped machine code, their output is pseudo-C. If you don't know C memory models, pointer arithmetic, and struct layouts inside and out, reading decompilation is like reading a foreign language without a dictionary.
* **Vulnerabilities stem from C semantics:** Memory corruption bugs (buffer overflows, integer overflows, use-after-free, type confusion) exist because C provides raw access to pointers and memory without automatic safety checks.

## Interactive Practice

Each lesson in this course includes:
1. **Under the Hood / Disassembly Insights:** Side-by-side analysis of how the C code compiles into ARM64 and x86_64 assembly.
2. **Reverse Engineering Takeaways:** Real-world vulnerability patterns and how decompilers interpret the code.
3. **Interactive Exercises & Challenges:** Hands-on exercises you can practice and test directly.
